My PhD thesis
The styles worked only with cp-1251 encoding for me.

The working files are aref1 and thesis4_6.

Everything should work out of the box, except some warnings. To use cyrilic in bibtex, use bibtexu in the settings of your editor, and add language entry in your bib file.

To compile use Latex->div2ps->ps2pdf .

The UTF version also works but ONLY for thesis (with some style downgrades); it can be used in Overleaf.
